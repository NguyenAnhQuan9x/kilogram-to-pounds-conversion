            Pounds (lb) and kilograms (kg) are two important units of mass and weight. The units are used for body
            weight, produce weight, and many other measurements.
            How to convert <a href="https://www.calculatorful.com/kilograms-to-pounds">kilograms to pounds</a> is shown in
            the worked example problem below. This is a typical problem with
            converting mass units.
            Let's start with a food example since recipes are one of the most frequent practical uses for this
            conversion:
        </p>
        <p>
            Maybe you have a problem: A man weighs 76 kg. What is his weight in pounds?
        </p>
        <p>
            Start with the conversion factor between pounds and kilograms.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="formula">
                1 kg = 2.2 lbs
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Write this in the form of an equation to solve for pounds:
        </p>
        <p>
            weight in lb = weight in kg / (1 kg / 2.2 lb)
        </p>
        <p>
            The kilogram cancel out, leaving pounds. In essence this means all you have to do to get a pounds weight in
            kilogram is multiply by 2.2:
        </p>
        <p>
            x lbs = 76kg / 1 kg/2.2 lbs<br>
            x lbs = 167.2 lbs<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            In life sometimes we will not have enough time to write the formula then enter the numbers into the
            calculator
            and get the result on the screen.
